        bet_sizes: The bet sizes available to the agent. These correspond to
            the final reward.
        num_decks: The number of individual decks combined into a single deck.
            In Vegas, this is usually between four and eight.
        max_rounds: The maximum number of rounds where the agent and dealer
            can hit/stay. There is no max in real blackjack, however this
            would result in a very large observation space.
        games_per_episode: The number of games per episode. This must be set high
            for card-counting to have an effect. When set to one, the game
            becomes fully observable.
